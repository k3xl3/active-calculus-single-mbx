<p>Our work in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-8-6-2.html" title="Activity 8.6.3">ActivityÂ 8.6.3</a> holds more generally. The corresponding theorem, which we will not prove, states that we can differentiate a power series for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> term by term and obtain the series expansion for <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> and similarly we can integrate a series expansion for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> term by term and obtain the series expansion for <span class="process-math">\(\int f(x) \ dx\text{.}\)</span> For both, the radius of convergence of the resulting series is the same as the original, though it is possible that the convergence status of the various series may differ at the endpoints. The formal statement of the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem follows.</p>
